                            > STACKING JEWELLERY Stacking jewellery is a popular trend that allows you to showcase your unique style by layering different pieces together. Here are some ideas to help you stack your...
                                Start by choosing a statement piece of jewellery, such as a watch or an elegant bracelet cuff, a bold pendant necklace, or a pair of dangler drop earrings. This piece will serve as the focal point of your stack.
                                Feel free to mix different textures and materials, such as gemstones, leather, beads, metal, and fabric, to add depth and interest to your stack.
                                Vary the lengths of necklaces for a visually appealing look. Add a choker or collar necklace to frame your face.
                                Mixing metals and plating colours can add dimension to your stack. Try pairing silver plated and gold or rose gold plated 925 sterling silver and even hypoallergenic stainless steel for a chic, modern look.
                                Experiment with different colours to create a fun and playful stack. Mix and match bright hues or stick to a single colour palette for a cohesive look.

                            >SILVER METAL TEST Sure, we all know about the typical stamps like "S925," "925," or "BIS Hallmark" that guarantee the authenticity of stunning sterling silver. But, did you know there...
                                Sniff Test
                                To check if an item is a sterling silver, wipe and dry it, then hold it up to your nose and smell it. Genuine sterling silver does not have a smell. Because it has a very low presence of copper, lower-purity silver may have a faint coppery smell due to the high presence of copper as an alloy.

                                Bend Test
                                To check if an item is made of pure or high-quality sterling silver, gently bend it with your hands. If it bends easily, it's likely silver; if it doesn't, it's less likely to be silver.

                                Rub Test
                                To determine if an item is a sterling silver, rub a portion of it with the ‚ÄúSilver Polish Cloth‚Äù provided with each sterling silver item order at Blinglane or a clean, white cloth. If black residue comes off, it is sterling silver. If not, it is likely not sterling silver.

                                Magnet Test
                                To check if an item is made of real sterling silver, run a strong magnet over it. If the item is not attracted to the magnet, it is likely made of sterling silver. However, if the item sticks to the magnet, it is not sterling silver and may be made of highly polished white metal that resembles silver.
